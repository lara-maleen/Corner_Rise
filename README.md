# Corner_Rise
Here you find the R script used for analysis of video data from OER NOAA Cruise 2104 to Corner Rise Seamounts (CRS) in 2021. 

The directory /raw_data includes all files needed for the script and analysis. It also includes the density files, which were created separately for each forest patch.
